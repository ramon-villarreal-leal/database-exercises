# WHERE CLAUSE LECTURE

# The Where clause allows us to craft queries based on very specific criteria

# The following concepts will be covered:
# LIKE
# BETWEEN
# IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
# Comparison Operators
# IN
# DISTINCT
# Chaining WHERE clauses

USE employees;

select database();

SHOW TABLES;

# example queries on the employees table

select * from salaries;

DESCRIBE employees;

# Basic WHERE Clause
# the list of employees that were hired in 1987-02-23
SELECT first_name, last_name

WHERE hire_date = '1987-02-23';

# LIKE and wild cards
# all the employees with a first name that starts with "F"
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'f%';

# all the employees whose last name ends with ing
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '%ing';

# all the employees with "in" somewhere in their first name
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%in%';

# BETWEEN
# all the employees that has an employee number between 12434 and 12440
SELECT *
